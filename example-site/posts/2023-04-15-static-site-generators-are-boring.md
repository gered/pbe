It's true.

Static site generators are boring. Sure, they can be used to generate all the files necessary for many types of
websites and then be uploaded somewhere and served up in an incredible efficient fashion.

But they're boring. 

And there's so many of them out there. And I really can't be arsed to futz about with their endless configuration
options and templating and so forth.

Bleh!
