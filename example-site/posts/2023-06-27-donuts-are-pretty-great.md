Donuts are pretty great. Even better when you have more than one. Especially so when you have sprinkles on some or all
of them. And this all becomes _significantly better_ when paired up with coffee. Which should always be just black, 
because why would anyone want to do something gross like dunk extra sugar, milk or cream into your coffee? What a 
horrible thing to do ...
